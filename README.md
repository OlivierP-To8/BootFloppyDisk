# Bootable Floppy Disk for Thomson TO or MO

This project contains everything you need to make a bootable floppy disk for any TO or MO machine, even without DOS.
The boot sector loads and launches the added binaries one after the other.
The Makefile contains all the necessary commands.
The MOTO boot sector works on both MO and TO, so a single double-sided floppy disk can be used for all Thomsons. The first side must contain TO binaries, as the TO9's built-in reader only works with the first side.
